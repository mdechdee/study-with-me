## **Description**
### The project is still in prototyping stage!
Study with me is a social platform that will aggregate readers as a group, allowing them to share thier reading progresses together. The platform applies social pressure as a motivation by notifying them to update thier progresses after an interval of time. The implementation of this project is done using React.js in JavaScript ES6 and SCSS also firebase as our main database and storages. The platform is designed to be used on mobile and on contemporary browsers especially Chrome.  
The structure of our source code is based on React components and router. The beginning layer of the site render can be found in App.js which will route you to MyGroup.js, FindGroups.js, Profile.js, Signin.js and SignOut.js. Each of the javascript file will include components inside their class and render them in render method. All of the components source code files are in the /src folder. Our site use SCSS files to style itself, the files can be found in ./src/scss folder and they have thier name correspond to the class they are styling.
